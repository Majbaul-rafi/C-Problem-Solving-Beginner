# C Programming Problem Solving Portfolio_Beginner
All C programs I solved during my university practice journey.

Welcome to my personal C programming problem-solving repository!  
This repo contains 150+ C programs I solved during my university journey, covering a wide range of basic to intermediate topics.

---
##  Topics Covered :
✅ Loop-based problems  
✅ Array operations (insert, delete, search)  
✅ Series calculations (e.g., 1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + ... + 1/n)  
✅ Functions and recursive programs  
✅ Pattern printing  
✅ Basic math logic  
✅ File handling (coming soon)

##  Why I Made This Repo

🔹 To track my daily progress in C programming  
🔹 To build a strong foundation for DSA and future languages (Java, Python)  
🔹 To create a coding portfolio for internships and jobs  
🔹 To help others who are also learning C

## Example Problems
- Reverse an array  
- Calculate factorial using recursion  
- Find GCD of two numbers  
- Print a pattern using nested loop  
- Sum of n terms in a fractional series  
- Fibonacci series (recursive and loop)
---

##  Upcoming Plans

🔸 Add Java and Python versions of solved problems  
🔸 Solve DSA topics (linked list, stack, queue, tree) in C  
🔸 Upload weekly challenge problems with solution
